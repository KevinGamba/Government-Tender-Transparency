## Project Name:- Clear Tender

# Goal:- Government-Tender-Transparency
A blockchain-based government tender platform that ensures transparency in procurement processes, preventing corruption and enabling accountability.
Using Aptos blockchain, it tracks tender submissions and ensures no tender is lost or tampered with, ensuring fair competition.


### Problem Statement:
In Kenya, public procurement processes are often mired in corruption scandals, such as the Adani scandal, where tenders were not properly managed, 
leading to financial losses for taxpayers. Citizens are calling for greater accountability and transparency in how tenders are awarded and managed.

### Approach:
Using blockchain, this project would create a decentralized, transparent tendering system where government bodies can submit, review, and award tenders
on a public, immutable ledger. This system would eliminate the "lost tender" claims and provide a transparent audit trail for every transaction.

### Vision:
To restore trust in public procurement systems, reducing corruption, and enabling better use of taxpayer money through a transparent, accountable process.

### Technological Stack:
-Blockchain platform: Aptos
-Smart Contracts: Aptos SDK for writing the tendering logic
-User Interface (UI): React.js or Next.js for a simple frontend dashboard
-Wallet Integration: Aptos-compatible wallet for tender submission and payment management
